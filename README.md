## Hi there, I'm Eganh, a Full Stack Developer!

With a strong foundation in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a solid understanding of backend technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL, I am able to develop end-to-end solutions for various web development projects.
